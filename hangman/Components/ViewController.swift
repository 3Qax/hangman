    /// Flag indicating whether top keyboard layout guide should be tracked.
    /// It is recommended to set this flag in view controller's init method
    /// cause keyboard may appear before the view controller's view is fully loaded.
    ///
    /// Setting this property to `true` automatically registers view controller for keyboard notifications.
    /// Setting this property to `false` automatically removes view controller from keyboard notifications.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// Few view controllers have been initialized at once but only one of them has been displayed.
    /// It means that only this one which is visible, loaded its view.
    /// Other view controllers will load their views (technically invoke viewDidLoad() method)
    /// shortly before they become visible.
    ///

    /// - Warning: Switching to emoji keyboard by pressing the language selector button (the globe) works fine.
    ///            Neverthelss when changing keyboard type by long pressing the language selector button,
    ///            no UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame notification is sent what causes layout guide to not be adjusted properly.
